This provides an API to select a set from a
powerset of some given elements. The elements
are specified with `add-element!`. The choose
operation returns a subset of the elements with
the constraint that it is not a super set of
any of the sets that have been passed to
`add-subset`. If there is no such subset,
it returns #f.

Currently the implementation considers only
singletons and returns #f when it cannot find
one of those.

idea:
 - take the smallest subset that's known to not fail and add one element to it...after a failure
 - after a success, just add one element to the previous success
